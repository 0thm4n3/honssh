HonSSH is designed to be used in conjuction with a high interaction honeypot. HonSSH sits between the attacker and the honey pot and creates two separate SSH conncetions.

Run HonSSH using the honsshctrl.sh script - Thanks Black September.

HonSSH is inspired and partly based on Kippo.

Kippo is a medium interaction SSH honeypot designed to log brute force attacks
and most importantly, the entire shell interaction by the attacker.

Kippo is inspired, but not based on Kojoney."
